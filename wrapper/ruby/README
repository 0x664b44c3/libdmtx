README for libdmtx-ruby version 0.6.1 - November 23, 2008
-----------------------------------------------------------------

libdmtx-ruby a Ruby wrapper for libdmtx that was written by
Romain Goyet and is distributed as part of the libdmtx
package.

I - Setup

This Ruby wrapper relies on RMagick, and of course on libdmtx.

1/ Install RMagick : http://rmagick.rubyforge.org/
2/ Build libdmtx (./configure --prefix=/a/given/path )
3/ ruby extconf.rb --with-dmtx-dir=/a/given/path (same as step 2)
4/ make clean
5/ make

II - Usage
Once the plug-in is built, you can toy around with the "test.rb"
sample script. It demonstrates both reading and writing.

Reading : ruby test.rb /path/to/an/image.file
Writing : ruby test.rb (It'll write something to "output.png")
