=================================================================

               libdmtx README file (all platforms)

This summary of the libdmtx package applies generally to all
platforms. For instructions regarding your specific platform
please also read the README.xxx file in this directory that
matches your system (e.g., README.linux, README.windows,
README.osx, etc...).


1. Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------

libdmtx is open source software for reading and writing Data
Matrix barcodes on Linux, Unix, OS X, Windows, and certain mobile
devices. At its core libdmtx is a shared library, allowing C/C++
programs to use its capabilities without restrictions or
overhead.

The included utility programs, dmtxread and dmtxwrite, serve as
the official interface to libdmtx from the command line, and also
provide a good reference for programmers who wish to write their
own programs that interact with libdmtx. All of the software in
the libdmtx package is distributed under the LGPL and can be used
freely under these terms.


2. Installation
-----------------------------------------------------------------

libdmtx uses GNU Autotools so installation should be familiar to
free software veterans. If your platform cannot easily run the
Autotools scripts (e.g., MS Visual Studio) then please refer to
the appropriate platform-specific README.xxx located in this
directory for alternate instructions.

Most people can simply run the following:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ sudo make install

If the 'sudo' command is not configured on your system then
alternatively you can yell "Yeeehaww!" as you log in as root and
run this instead:

  $ make install

If you're awesome and it compiled on the first try, you can now
use the newly built library and utility programs that were just
installed system-wide. However, if something when wrong then keep
reading.

If you obtained libdmtx from its Subversion repository you
probably got an error saying something like "configure: error:
cannot find install-sh". Run this command and try again:

  $ ./autogen.sh

The autogen.sh command requires autoconf, automake, libtool, and
pkgconfig to be installed on your system.

Errors encountered during the "make" step are often a result of
missing software dependencies. These dependencies are listed in
Appendix A. of this file. Install any missing software and try
again.

For more information on the "./configure" step please read the
INSTALL file located in this directory. If the INSTALL file does
not exist then you may need to run the "./autogen.sh" step first.

If you want to ensure that everything built correctly you can
optionally build the test programs like this:

  $ make check

This command will not perform any tests, but will build the
programs that contain the test logic: simpletest, unittest,
and gltest. Note that the gltest program has significant
dependencies due to its graphical nature, and does not provide
significant utility unless you are testing the library decoding
internals.


3. Components
-----------------------------------------------------------------

libdmtx serves a diverse audience and contains several unrelated
components, many of which may not be useful to you. Package
components generally fall into one of four categories:

  * Core library      (useful to all libdmtx users)
  * Utility programs  (useful to command line users)
  * Language Wrappers (useful to non-C/C++ developers)
  * Test programs     (useful to libdmtx developers)

Appendix A. at the end of this file provides a full list of these
components and their properties.


4. Basic Usage
-----------------------------------------------------------------

New users are encouraged to read the man pages for the library
and command line utilities. However, here are a few simple cases
to get you started:

The dmtxwrite utility turns messages into a barcode images.
Messages are passed to dmtxwrite via file or standard input, and
the output images are written to file or standard output. The
following examples all produce equivalent results:

  $ echo -n 123456 | dmtxwrite > image.png
  $ echo -n 123456 | dmtxwrite -o image.png
  $ echo -n 123456 > message.txt; dmtxwrite message.txt > image.png
  $ dmtxwrite <(echo -n 123456) -o image.png

Conversely,the dmtxread utility turns barcode images into
messages. Images are passed to dmtxread via standard input or
file, and the output is written to standard output. The following
examples both produce equivalent results:

  $ dmtxread -n image.png
  $ cat image.png | dmtxread -n

Other typical cases:

  $ dmtxread -n -N1 image1.png image2.png image3.png
  $ dmtxread -n -N1 -m500 image.png

You can even combine the utilities like this:

  $ echo 'Hello, world!' | dmtxwrite | dmtxread
  Hello, world!

  $ dmtxread image1.png | dmtxwrite -o image2.png

Note in this last example that the resulting image2.png might
look different than image1.png. Both barcodes will contain an
identical message, but the shape of the barcode and the internal
representation of the encoded bits may be completely different.
