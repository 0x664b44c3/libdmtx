README for libdmtx version 0.3.0 - October 15, 2006
-----------------------------------------------------------------

libdmtx version 0.3.0 doesn't have all the features I was hoping
to add before the next release, but it's at a point where I need
to break the library for a while in order to rip out and replace
the main region detection algorithm.

Before breaking the CVS version, though, I'm releasing v0.3 so
everyone can continue using the latest code with all the
restructuring, bug fixes, and enhancements that have happened
since v0.2.

Revisiting the disclaimers from earlier releases, you might pick
up on a more optimistic tone:

   * It shouldn't crash very often anymore (please let me know)
   * It definitely shouldn't hang your system
   * The API will still change, but not as frequently

I'm already working on the next release, so hopefully it won't
take as long to get it out the door.  And a special thanks to
everyone who has contributed questions, ideas, bug reports, and
patches since the last release.

As always, if you have any questions or problems then please post
a message to one of the libdmtx forums at:
