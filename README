README for libdmtx version 0.5.1 - July 1, 2008
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The libdmtx 0.5.1 mini-release provides important bug fixes and
functionality improvements, mainly for the benefit of users who
don't use the latest code from Subversion. The changes in 0.5.1
are incremental by nature and stem from a few factors:

  * An incomplete libfec integration from version 0.5.0
  * Feature importance identified by real-world users
  * Increasing use of libdmtx on non-Linux platforms

The next major release will continue to focus on overall barcode
reading performance, and this release lays some of the necessary
groundwork. These changes include:

Bug Fixes

  * Fixed error correction bug with interleaved blocks
  * Fixed Extended ASCII encoding bug
  * Fixed experimental Data Mosaic decoding

General Improvements

  * Added timeout condition for region detection
  * Added optional disabling of error correction
  * Added beginnings of new "dmtxquery" utility
  * Added unit test program for verifying internals
  * Filled lots of holes in source comments (Doxygen)

Cross Platform Improvements

  * New conditional build logic surrounding libtiff code
  * Replaced DmtxPixel struct with DmtxRgb for safe pixel copies
  * New local copies of getopt1.c, getopt.c, and getopt.h
  * Various preprocessor additions to help compiling in MS VC++
  * New Cocoa wrapper for iPhone, iPod Touch, OS X (thanks Stefan!)

As always, please let us know if you find any bugs or have
trouble installing the software. Instructions for posting to the
