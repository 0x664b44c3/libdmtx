README for libdmtx version 0.5.0 - April 13, 2008
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.5.0 brings libdmtx a big step closer to earning the
"Production Ready" label.  As predicted, the major untested
changes in 0.4.0 required a stabilization period to work out the
kinks, but the library now appears more stable and better
equipped to scan mixed-quality input than any previous version.
This release also introduces a critical feature that many users
have been waiting for: Reed Solomon error correction!

With a big thanks to the authors of libfec (Forward Error
Correction library) and a patch submitted by Florian Kandzia,
libdmtx can reliably fix many barcode errors instead of simply
printing the dreaded "Rejected due to ECC validation" warning.
This feature directly improves both the success rates and runtime
performance of Data Matrix scans, and will make our software
immediately relevant to a number of organizations.

Other new features include:

  * Scan grid pattern is now handled by library internally
  * Better module color decisions (improves success rates)
  * library now returns pre-decoded regions; gives choice
  * Ability to scan specific portions of an image
  * Barcode rotation printed in dmtxread verbose mode

At a project level, libdmtx has seen a dramatic increase in
traffic and downloads since the 0.4.0 release.  Compared to the
period before the year-long freeze in 2007, monthly website
visits have increased nearly 300% during the last four months.
Additionally, the software has been used on a number of new
platforms including Windows, Macintosh, Solaris, and a few mobile
phones (YouTube has some cool demos).

version 0.6 will focus on performance
