Installing libdmtx
-----------------------------------------------------------------

I haven't taken the time to get autoconf(1) set up for this
package, and it's not designed to install in the normal library
locations (/usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, etc...).  Instead, it will
build in the source directory and you can run the test program
from its own source directory.

To build libdmtx:
   $ make

(that was easy)

You may get an error from the chcon command in the Makefile.  It
is there due to an SELinux issue that I ran into when I first
upgraded to Fedora Core 5.  It doesn't seem to be necessary
anymore, but I'm leaving it in until I have more time to
experiment.  For now, just ignore the error.

The test program is located in the "libdmtx/test/gltest"
directory.  Like before, just run "make" to build it.  The gltest
program uses OpenGL (Mesa) to simulate raw camera input.  If it
successfully finds and decodes a Data Matrix symbol then it will
write the decoded stream to STDOUT.

Note that if you want to run the gltest binary directly you first
have to point LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the directory where libdmtx.so
was built.  You can do it like this:

   $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:}../..

or simply run the script "run_gltest.sh", which does it for you
automatically.

The gltest program is somewhat boring if you don't know that you
can right-click to cycle through the test images.  To add your
own images, just overwrite any image in the
libdmtx/test/test_images directory with another 256x256 PNG file.
If you want to add new images (instead of overwriting) then you
will have to update the gFilename[] and gFileCount variables at
the top of gltest.c to include them.

I have only tried running this on Fedora 4 & 5, and have no
reason to believe that it will work anywhere else.  In fact, if
you try it and have a minute to spare, please drop me an email at
mike@dragonflylogic.com to let me know how it went.  I don't need
much information, but if you could let me know about your
experience it would be incredibly helpful.
