  x Deploy codebase to SourceForge CVS
  x Add revision control keywords to source files
  x Implement remaining encodation schemes in dmtxdecode.c (X12, Base 256, etc...)
  x Create separate file for callback functions (allows them to be optional)
  x Move PNG (and other format) logic and dependencies to dmtxread, dmtxwrite, etc...
  x Fix the regressions (crash bugs) introduced during v0.2 structural rework
  x Add multi-page TIFF capabilities to dmtxread
  x Move pure decode calls from dmtxScanLine into a dmtxdecode.c function
  x Sample module color from more than one pixel location
  x Rename DmtxVector3 to DmtxColor3 and merge into dmtxcolor.c

  x Build coding style test scripts
  x Replace current calibration size estimate with new approach
  x Size step size dynamically according to pixel size
  x Improved dmtxwrite (fixed bugs, implemented -o option)
  x Increase dmtxread default scanline count (feasible because of better stability)

version 0.2: (11-Jun-2006)
  x Move dmtxCapturePixel routine to library code
  x Initial restructuring of code for architectural goodness
  x Improve API for real-world use (and not just dumping results to STDOUT)

future versions:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Website:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  o Explore using single background image instead of split
  o Add what we currently do, don't do, would like to do in the future
