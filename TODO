next: Update MatrixRegionAlignFirstEdge() logic
next: Update MatrixRegionAlignSecondEdge() logic

after version 0.5.2:
  o libdmtx:   Finish fec integration (encode_rs_char, aLog[], etc...)
  o libdmtx:   Use new Edifact decode function that doesn't assume full triplet
  o libdmtx:   Check ProcessEndOfSymbolTriplet() for same problem fixed in Edifact
  o libdmtx:   Rewrite encoder(s) to not need "twothirdsbits" tracking (fixes multiple bugs)
  o libdmtx:   Allow choice of edge-drop condition passed to MatrixRegionAlignEdge()
  o libdmtx:   Implement image mask to track scan progress and avoid rescanned pixels
  o libdmtx:   Implement consistent and robust error handling (errno.h + custom)
  o libdmtx:   Rename outputIdx to outputLength? (Count pad codewords instead of pointer)
  o libdmtx:   Implement --auto-fast option using algorithm from spec (lighter & faster?)
  o libdmtx:   Implement overlap detection to avoid rescanning in successfully decoded regions
  o libdmtx:   Implement structured append symbols
  o dmtxread:  Write fully structured debug barcode dump from dmtxread (currently just mapping grid)
  o dmtxread:  Print out image representing "unstretched" barcode
  o dmtxread:  Print color weights based on direction
  o dmtxread:  Change dmtxread to print out dump of both failed and successful barcodes if requested

               - Build color vector that describes jump from background to foreground color
               - When module is determined to be "off" then add half of color vector
               - When module is determined to be "on" then subtract half of color vector
               - resulting image should clearly show misread modules
  o dmtxread:  Change dmtxread to print out trail left by scanning logic (future)
  o dmtxread:  JPEG reading support
  o dmtxread:  Print character values (not just codewords) from --codewords (-c) option
  o dmtxwrite: Print character values (not just codewords) from --format=c (-fc) option
  o dmtxwrite: Verbose messages describing encoding process
  o testsuite: Generate metrics in reproducible format to enable historical tracking
  o testsuite: Investigate option of embedding decoded text into PNG test image comments
  o testsuite: Tests should compare scanned results to embedded PNG comments
  o testsuite: Implement exhaustive comparison between --auto-fast and --auto-best
  o testsuite: 'make test' writes metrics file
