TODO Items
-----------------------------------------------------------------

IMMEDIATE
   x switch to incremental (one matrix) approach, which passes back buffer no matter what
      x Remove dmtxScanStartNew()
      x Remove dmtxDecodeGetMatrixCount()
      x Remove dmtxDecodeGetMatrix()
      x Add status

   x write buffer dumping function in dmtxread (takes into account b&w or rgb barcode dumps)

   x finsh writing and integrate 4-direction weighted module reads (see notes at bottom)

   / pass decision back to calling program whether to scan (requiring malloc) it
   o change dmtxFindNextRegion() to return region (not malloc'd)
   o update gltest to use the new calling structure

   / rename DmtxMatrixRegion to DmtxRegion
   o split out actual data fields
   o remove mosaic field from DmtxDecode (and replace functionality by calling dedicated named function)
   o remove DmtxRegion from decode and pass it between functions explicitly

   o write fully structured debug barcode dump from dmtxread (currently just mapping grid)
   o add data to the malloc'd image buffer (for writing log data and tracking progress)
   o improve black/white decision process
   o consider changing rounding of zero crossing math to nearest center between pixels

   o print out image representing "unstretched" barcode

   o nominal predicted barcode in another color
   o print color weights based on direction
   o Temporarily modify dmtxregion to dump directional weights
   o Change dmtxScanPixel() to also return false hits -- found a barcode but ECC failed
   o Change dmtxread to print out dump of both failed and successful barcodes if requested
   o Change dmtxread to print out mis-read modules somehow ... additive, subtractive?
      - Build color vector that describes jump from background to foreground color
      - When module is determined to be "off" then add half of color vector
      - When module is determined to be "on" then subtract half of color vector
      - resulting image should clearly show misread modules
   o Change dmtxread to print out trail left by scanning logic (future)

   -D, --diagnose="nop"
       n = None [default]
       o = Overlay image with module color decisions
       p = Path taken by region detection logic
