README for pydmtx version 0.5.2 - September 4, 2008
-----------------------------------------------------------------

pydmtx is a thin wrapper around libdmtx that reads and writes
Data Matrix barcodes as PIL Image objects.  Dan Watson wrote
the original version of pydmtx in 2006, and allowed it to
become a native part of the libdmtx package.
