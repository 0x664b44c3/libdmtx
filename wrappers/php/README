README for libdmtx PHP extension - July 1, 2008
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The mechanism for calling libdmtx from PHP is currently in
an unresolved state. There are two known efforts, both with
different features and levels of completeness:

1) Christian Hentschel developed a PHP extension for encoding
   Data Matrix barcodes using libdmtx. He describes it as an
   early version that he quickly coded for libdmtx version 0.4.
   He graciously donated his code and is allowing it to be
   released under LGPLv2.

2) Another effort is underway to develop a complete encoding/
   decoding PHP wrapper. Their goal is to get the final product
   included in the PHP Extension Community Library (PECL).

Since the PHP code available today does not compile with recent
libdmtx versions and the final solution may not be hosted as part
of the libdtmx package, for now I am leaving out any PHP code and
making Christian's package available as a separate download:
